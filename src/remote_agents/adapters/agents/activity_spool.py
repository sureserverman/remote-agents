"""Spool what an agent hook observed into the service's private activity directory.

This runs as a hook inside the agent's own process, not inside the service, which fixes two
things about it. The first is that it must never fail loudly: anything raised here surfaces in
the session the operator is working in, so losing one activity record is always the lesser
failure and every path below ends in exit status zero. The second is that it is reachable by
any agent on the machine, so the environment variable the service exports decides whether to
spool at all: absent or malformed, this writes nothing. That is a guarantee about a session
that merely *doesn't have* the variable - the ordinary case of an operator running claude by
hand - and it is worth stating exactly that narrowly. It is not a guarantee against a process
that sets the variable deliberately, and no check here could be: the spool is owner-only, the
hook runs as that owner, and anything else running as that owner can write into the directory
without going through this file at all.

What the guard below does buy, which the variable cannot, is that an *authorized* record
lands where it was meant to. Deciding who may spool says nothing about where the spool goes,
so the directory is opened through a check that refuses a symlink left lying in wait rather
than through a plain mkdir, which would follow one.

What lands here is deliberately narrower than what the hook receives. The notification the
service will send needs an event name, the field that discriminates that event, one short
line of detail, a session, and a time; the transcript path and working directory the payload
also carries would leak filesystem layout into a Telegram message, so they never leave here.
